## Implementation Priorities

For the most impactful improvements, we recommend implementing these features in the following order:

1. Multi-point buoyancy model (greatest impact on realism)
2. Wake generation and two-way coupling
3. Water entry/exit effects
4. Hydrodynamic forces
5. Wind-water interaction improvements

These enhancements will significantly improve the realism and immersion of boat-water interaction while maintaining reasonable performance overhead.
